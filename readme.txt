This is a Python-based CRUD web app that serves as a repository for hosting artifacts for a virtual museum. 
The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete museum artifacts through a web interface. 
The app currently has the capability for hosting and displaying artifacts, exhibits, and news for archaeology only. 
Templates for future functionality for other subjects are available, but most are currently disabled.
