<h1 class="hist_title">A Brief History of the CT Hurst Museum</h1>
<div class="paragraphs">
    <p class="elements"> 
        The CT Hurst Museum is located in Gunnison, Colorado, on the campus of Western Colorado University (WSCU), an 
        undergraduate liberal arts institution with about 2,500 students enrolled annually. Our anthropology program encourages 
        undergraduate research and requires majors to participate in at least two field schools. The CT Hurst Museum is a great 
        source of cultural and archaeological knowledge of the heritage of Gunnison Country and with recent changes in Colorado 
        State laws regarding the management of museum collections, the CT Hurst Museum finds itself no longer certified as a state 
        repository. Once we have completed our reorganization and assessment, the CT Hurst Museum will be better positioned to 
        fulfill our mission as a leader for outreach, education, research and collaboration on the Colorado past.

        The CT Hurst Museum’s small exhibit space, archive and curation room, archaeological offices, and wet laboratories are 
        housed in the Hurst building on WSCU’s campus.  The CT Hurst Museum collection encompasses artifacts and associated notes 
        from fieldwork beginning in the 1930’s with CT Hurst, to current field school materials recovered from the Mountaineer and 
        Tenderfoot Sites in Gunnison, directed by Mark Stiger since 1990.

        The CT Hurst Museum contains material from numerous significant collections including one made by CT Hurst from his fieldwork 
        in the 1930s and 1940s. The Hurst collection provides evidence of the earliest corn farming in Colorado, and artifact assemblages 
        from early Folsom and Windust occupations in Colorado. The designation of these sites range from being on the State Register to 
        eligible and recommended for the State Register. Another significant collection in the museum is from The Mountaineer and Tenderfoot 
        sites excavated by Stiger since the early 2000s and also contains evidence for some of the earliest people in the area and is on the 
        State Registrar of Historic Places (State Register 3/9/1994, 5GN.1835).

        In the early 1930s, CT Hurst, came to what was then known as Western State College as a professor of zoology. His shift to archaeological 
        research was the result, as least in part, of a loan to Western of a private collection of Southwest pottery and other materials, 
        which he studied, curated, and exhibited. In 1935 he and Gunnison Mayor H.W. Endner, helped establish the Colorado Archaeological 
        Society and began publishing Southwestern Lore. In the late 1930s Hurst and Endner, and the Colorado Archaeological Society, established the first archaeology museum at Western 
        State College. Hurst initially conducted field work in the late 1930s at a Folsom site in the San Luis Valley, then later at a cave 
        site in the same region.

        Later Hurst worked on the Uncompahgre Plateau at Tabeguache Cave (State Register 9/11/1996, 5MN.868), Dolores Cave (State Register 
        9/11/1996, 5MN.915), and Cottonwood Cave (State Register 9/11/1996, 5MN.519). These sites were occupied by many peoples, including 
        Ancestral Puebloan, Fremont, and Gateway, and contained early evidence of farming in the region. Among the many artifacts from these 
        sites are numerous perishable items such as corncobs, baskets, yucca sandals, deer hides, a split-twig figurine, and many bone fragments 
        which are part of the Hurst Museum collection.  <br> &emsp; &emsp;Additional items in the CT Hurst Museum include various collections 
        donated over the years. For example the Peterson collection, which consists of partial skeletal remains of about 20 human individuals 
        and ceramic vessels probably from the Durango area. Provenience data is minimal to non-existent. Peterson collected these materials back 
        in the 1930s and when he passed away, Peterson’s brother, a Western alum, donated them to the museum.

        In August of 1948, Hurst took a leave from Western to study museum curation at the Peabody Museum at Harvard University. 
        While in Cambridge he became ill with pneumonia and in January of 1949 passed away, leaving the management of the museum uncertain. 
        In either the 1960s or early 1970s, the collection was boxed up and put into storage. For the next couple of decades the collection was 
        passed around from one building to another, from one storage room or basement to another.

        In the 1970s, John Gooding of the Colorado Department of Highways and adjunct at Henderson Museum CU-Boulder obtained a loan of Hurst 
        Uncompahgre materials from Western State College. With no archaeologist on the faculty, the college president approved a short-term loan 
        of the artifacts and all field records to be housed at the Henderson Museum. Upon being hired at Western State in 1989, Stiger began an assessment of the archaeological collection, now stored in a large shared space 
        in Hurst. Among other things, he was able to track down and retrieve the materials borrowed in the 1970s.  It is unclear how, but the 
        Hurst Uncompahgre artifacts and field notes were being stored in cardboard boxes in a garage in Boulder. In 2001, the Hurst building was expanded with the construction of an additional wing. At that time a space specifically designed for the 
        collection was built, and is the current location of the Hurst Museum.
